I'm an Assistant Professor in Data Science at the University of San Francisco (USF). Specifically, I teach as part of the Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) program. 

I recently returned to academia after a nearly 10 year stint working as a Data Scientist and Data Science Manager/Director/Sr Director across multiple companies while living in the SF Bay Area. Most of what I wanted to accomplish in industry, I did, and am now very back in academia, despite the complaints of most academia-to-industry converts. Yes, I went in the reverse direction, as did many of my colleagues here at USF.
