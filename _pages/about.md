I'm an Assistant Professor in Data Science at the University of San Francisco (USF). Specifically, I am part of the Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) program and teach courses in Machine Learning, Probability & Statistics, MLOps, and Ethics.

I recently returned to academia after a nearly 10 year career in industry as a Data Scientist and Data Science Manager/Director/Sr Director across multiple companies in the San Francisco Bay Area. While my time in industry was fun and educational, and I use my experiences in the classroom, I was always happy in academia and I have found my new career to be fun and rewarding. 

Aside from teaching I am also the Director of the [Center for AI and Data Ethics](https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute/centers-initiatives/caide) where we develop educational resources, case studies, and highlight our ethics-related student [practicum](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/programs/graduate/data-science/practicum) projects.

Creating a research program has been the most difficult part of my transition back into academia after being away from my doctoral research for so long. My interests lie in data/AI ethics, MLOps, and data science education.
