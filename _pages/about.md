I'm an Assistant Professor in Data Science at the University of San Francisco (USF). Specifically, I am part of the Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) program and teach courses in Machine Learning, Probability & Statistics, MLOps, and Ethics.

I recently returned to academia after a nearly 10 year career in industry as a Data Scientist and Data Science Manager/Director/Sr Director across multiple companies in the San Francisco Bay Area. While my time in industry was fun and educational, I was always happier in academia and I have found my new career to be particularly rewarding. 

Aside from teaching I am also the Director of the [Center for AI and Data Ethics](https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute/centers-initiatives/caide) where we develop educational resources and case studies for AI ethics, and highlight our student [practicum](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/programs/graduate/data-science/practicum) projects that focus on ethical considerations.

I co-host the [USF Data Science Podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/dsbeginnings) with faculty member [Cody Carroll](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/cody-carroll). Our main goal is to inform incoming students about our MSDS program and provide learning and career advice to our current students. 

My research interests lie in data/AI ethics, MLOps, and data science education.

I have a PhD in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles.
