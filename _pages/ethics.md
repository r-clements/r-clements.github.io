I am the current director of the [Center for AI and Data Ethics](https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute/centers-initiatives/caide) at University of San Francisco, where we work on creating educational resources and content for AI and data ethics issues, partner with organizations on practicum projects that have an ethics component, and offer ethics courses related to AI and data science.
