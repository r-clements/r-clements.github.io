I am the current director of the [Center for AI and Data Ethics](https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute/centers-initiatives/caide) at University of San Francisco, where we work on creating educational resources and content for AI and data ethics issues, partner with organizations on practicum projects that have an ethics component, and offer ethics courses related to AI and data science. 

## Case Studies 

In the past I've worked with undergraduate students on creating this set of case studies for any AI/Data Ethics course. They are suitable for both non-technical and technical audiences. The goal of the case studies project is to expand these case studies to include technical exercises for STEM students and discussion questions for law students.
